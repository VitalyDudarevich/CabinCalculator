		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Audit text color issues on iPhone",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audit process into specific steps for different parts of the application",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a systematic approach to review all text elements, which can be time-consuming and detail-oriented. The complexity comes from the need to thoroughly examine various components and test on specific devices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Fix text color definitions for iPhone compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the fix process into stages: updating CSS files, modifying React components, and handling dynamic text elements",
			"reasoning": "While the fix itself is straightforward, ensuring all text elements are covered and testing across different iOS versions adds some complexity. The task is dependent on the audit results, which may reveal unexpected issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Improve text contrast across all backgrounds",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the contrast improvement process by application sections and implement a color management system",
			"reasoning": "This task requires a good understanding of accessibility standards and involves making judgments about color choices. It may require iterations to find the right balance between aesthetics and readability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Diagnose Chrome black bar issue",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the diagnosis into stages: element inspection, style analysis, responsive design check, and documentation",
			"reasoning": "Diagnosing layout issues can be complex, especially when they're browser-specific. This task requires deep knowledge of CSS and browser rendering, and may involve trial and error to identify the root cause."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Fix overflow issues causing black bar in Chrome",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the fix into categories: container adjustments, element sizing, positioning fixes, and responsive design tweaks",
			"reasoning": "Implementing fixes for overflow issues can be tricky, as changes may have unintended consequences on the layout. Careful testing is required to ensure the fix doesn't introduce new problems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize horizontal scrolling behavior",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the optimization process into: global overflow control, specific element adjustments, and responsive design refinement",
			"reasoning": "This task builds on previous fixes and requires a good understanding of CSS overflow properties and responsive design principles. It's moderately complex due to the need to balance content accessibility with eliminating unwanted scrolling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement responsive design improvements",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down responsive design improvements into: media query updates, fluid sizing implementation, mobile-first approach, and device-specific adjustments",
			"reasoning": "Responsive design can be complex, requiring a deep understanding of CSS and various device behaviors. This task involves rethinking the layout approach and may require significant refactoring."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Fix TypeScript type issues",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide TypeScript fixes into: component prop types, event handler types, and state management types",
			"reasoning": "While TypeScript issues can be straightforward to fix, the complexity comes from ensuring type correctness across the entire application. The task requires good TypeScript knowledge but is generally less complex than layout issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Fix linter errors and implement CSS best practices",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into: addressing CSS linter warnings, implementing CSS best practices, fixing JavaScript/TypeScript linter errors, and code style consistency",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a wide range of small fixes and improvements. While individual fixes may be simple, ensuring consistency across the entire codebase and implementing best practices can be time-consuming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Cross-browser compatibility testing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide testing into phases for each major browser, device type, and specific functionality areas",
			"reasoning": "Cross-browser testing is highly complex due to the variety of browsers, devices, and potential issues to check. It requires a systematic approach, careful documentation, and potentially complex fixes for browser-specific problems."
